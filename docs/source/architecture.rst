Overview
--------

The Arnhem Postal History Project Django application has a single application: The :mod:`arnhem-app.postcards` application handles all related models, functionality, and views for viewing and interacting with postal material, people, and historical documents, while :class:`~arnhem-app.maps` handles the interface for the interactive map. 

More detailed `database documentation <https://dbdocs.io/hepplerj/Arnhem-Postal>`_ is autogenerated and hosted via dbdocs.io.
