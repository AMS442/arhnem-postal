            <p>The Arnhem Postal History Project (APH) is a digital public history project that makes available to the
                public
                for the first time over 5,000 individual letters and postcards circulated inside and outside the
                Netherlands
                between 1939 and 1945. The collection is a critical one for understanding the everyday lives of the
                Dutch during
                WWII through postal history. The collection provides important insights into key moments on the Dutch
                front,
                including the invasion of Holland, the emergence of the Holocaust in Holland, Operation Market Garden,
                and the
                resulting Hunger Winter, where thousands of Dutch civilians were intentially starved by the Nazis.</p>

            <p>Letters provide direct firsthand, conteporaneous records of the social impact of Word War II and the
                brutal
                battle that are now so well known to many. The post was the primary means of communications in a
                pre-cell phone
                world. Citizens relied on the post to provide news on extended family members. The post does this very
                well. The
                Dutch post office kept meticulous records and we know in detail when each item of mail went from one
                location to
                another.</p>

            <p>Postal artifacts provide a tangible connection and different perspective to events that may already be
                well-known
                to many. Almost be definition, every postal artifact includes inforrmation onthe sender as wella s the
                recipient; who sent it and to whome, and the cover is inscribed with precise information about the date
                and even
                the time of day that it was sent and the timing and route it took until delivered (or otherwise
                handled). As
                such the post provides a vibrant, contemporaneous testament to the experiences of the Dutch people and
                the
                combatants on both sides. Importantly, these artifacts were there when these tumultuous events occurred.
                They
                are not digital representations or recreations, but these scraps of paper with the sender's handwriting
                were
                actually present when these events took place.</p>

            <p>However, handwritten notes, letters and even books are fast being replaced by a digital world, with
                seemingly
                unlimited amounts of information (and disinformation) available on demand. While the digital is
                infintely
                reproducible, the older analog world is fast losing its remaining artifacts with fewer and fewer
                replacements
                available. This project focuses at the junction of the analog and the digital and estblishes an
                interactive
                "journey' where students and other can follow an authentic but very "old world" analog postal artifiacts
                as it
                travels through the Dutch countryside and the war.</p>

                    My name is Tim Gale and I am the Director of the Arnhem Postal History (APH) project, a
                    non-profit
                    entity based in the United States of America. The APH project examines the intersection of
                    social
                    and
                    military history and the role of the postal service during the Battle of Arnhem, and more
                    broadly
                    World
                    War 2 in Holland. Postal artifacts provide direct firsthand, contemporaneous records of the
                    social
                    impact of the brutal battle that is now so well known to many.

                    <p> Handwritten notes, letters, and even books are fast being replaced in a digital world,
                        with
                        seemingly
                        unlimited amounts of information (and disinformation) available on demand. While the
                        digital is
                        infinitely reproducible, the older analog world is fast losing its remaining artifacts
                        with fewer
                        and
                        fewer original sources available. It is our intention to focus on the junction of the
                        analog and the
                        digital and establish an interactive “journey” where students and others can follow
                        authentic but
                        very
                        “old world” analog postal artifacts, as they travel through the Dutch countryside. Whole
                        communities
                        of
                        enthusiasts, among which I include myself, spend hours researching the arcane details of
                        individual
                        soldiers’ experiences in specific rooms at houses dotted around Arnhem and the near-by
                        village of
                        Oosterbeek. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the experience of the
                        civilians
                        impacted by the Battle of Arnhem and the war.
                    </p>
                    <p>I did not set out to become a philatelist. In 2019, a life-long friend, who is a renowned
                        philatelist,
                        gave me a single “cover” addressed to Mevrouw (Mrs.) B. Haartsen-Heeck at Utrechtsweg
                        69,
                        Oosterbeek,
                        dated 25 September 1944. It started me thinking about the experiences of the lady whose
                        home was
                        located
                        right on the front line of the battle between the 1st British Airborne Division and
                        assorted
                        German
                        forces.</p>

            <div class="row">

                <p>My “pandemic project” has now grown into a collection of over 6,000 postal items sent
                    throughout
                    Holland
                    during the five years of war (1940-1945). Clearly, not all items within our collection are
                    specific
                    to
                    Arnhem nor do they all fall within the time frame of the battle, but many of them contribute
                    to an
                    understanding of a Dutch population enduring one of the most fierce battles of the Second
                    World War
                    as
                    it
                    was acted out in their homes and gardens.</p>
