    <h1>About the Arnhem Postal History Project</h1>

    <p>The Arnhem Postal History Project (APH) is a digital public history project that makes available to the public for the first time over 5,000 individual letters and postcards circulated inside and outside the Netherlands between 1939 and 1945. The collection is a critical one for understanding the everyday lives of the Dutch during WWII through postal history. The collection provides important insights into key moments on the Dutch front, including the invasion of Holland, the emergence of the Holocaust in Holland, Operation Market Garden, and the resulting Hunger Winter, where thousands of Dutch civilians were intentially starved by the Nazis.</p>

    <p>Letters provide direct firsthand, conteporaneous records of the social impact of Word War II and the brutal battle that are now so well known to many. The post was the primary means of communications in a pre-cell phone world. Citizens relied on the post to provide news on extended family members. The post does this very well. The Dutch post office kept meticulous records and we know in detail when each item of mail went from one location to another.</p>

    <p>Postal artifacts provide a tangible connection and different perspective to events that may already be well-known to many. Almost be definition, every postal artifact includes inforrmation onthe sender as wella s the recipient; who sent it and to whome, and the cover is inscribed with precise information about the date and even the time of day that it was sent and the timing and route it took until delivered (or otherwise handled). As such the post provides a vibrant, contemporaneous testament to the experiences of the Dutch people and the combatants on both sides. Importantly, these artifacts were there when these tumultuous events occurred. They are not digital representations or recreations, but these scraps of paper with the sender's handwriting were actually present when these events took place.</p>

    <p>However, handwritten notes, letters and even books are fast being replaced by a digital world, with seemingly unlimited amounts of information (and disinformation) available on demand. While the digital is infintely reproducible, the older analog world is fast losing its remaining artifacts with fewer and fewer replacements available. This project focuses at the junction of the analog and the digital and estblishes an interactive "journey' where students and other can follow an authentic but very "old world" analog postal artifiacts as it travels through the Dutch countryside and the war.</p>
