                <p> Kurt Arthur Zielenziger and Fritz Hirschberg knew each other from when they both lived in Berlin.
                    Hirschberg, a Dutch Jew, studied medicine in Germany and received his license to practice in 1914.
                    After Kristallnacht and the November 1939 pogrom, he was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen Concentration
                    Camp. After his release in January 1939, he fled to Norway. His escape was short-lived, as Germany
                    invaded Norway in April 1940. He lived underground until he was able to reach Sweden with other
                    refugees in November 1942. His 77-year-old mother, however, was arrested by the Gestapo and
                    eventually murdered in Auschwitz. </p>
                <p>The response section of a card Zielenziger had sent from Stockholm was returned on December 14,1943.

                    550 people had died.(See page 6). Lily survived, but only temporarily. The record shows that she
