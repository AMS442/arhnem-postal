                <p> Kurt Arthur Zielenziger and Fritz Hirschberg knew each other from when they both lived in Berlin.
                    Hirschberg, a Dutch Jew, studied medicine in Germany and received his license to practice in 1914.
                    After Kristallnacht and the November 1939 pogrom, he was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen Concentration
                    Camp. After his release in January 1939, he fled to Norway. His escape was short-lived, as Germany
                    invaded Norway in April 1940. He lived underground until he was able to reach Sweden with other
                    refugees in November 1942. His 77-year-old mother, however, was arrested by the Gestapo and
                    eventually murdered in Auschwitz. </p>
                <p>The response section of a card Zielenziger had sent from Stockholm was returned on December 14,1943.

                    friends with his non-Jewish neighbors, the Van Ouwerkerk family, as shown by surviving letters and

                    concluded from the fact that the day stamp ASSEN 5 was not used in the camp post office. Also, the
                    sender, likely Ernst Aron, wisely did not mention his name on the envelope so its origin could not
                    be traced. On September 4, 1944, he was deported to Theresienstadt. On October 16th of that same
                    year, he was transferred to Auschwitz where he was murdered two days later.</p>
