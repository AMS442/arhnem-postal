                <p>Letter from Camp Amersfoort to Uithuizen, near Groningen. Sent by a Dutch volunteer in the SS
                    Wachkommando, a unit that largely consisted of Ausland-Deutsche, German nationals who lived in
                    Holland. The Wachkommando was later used in military operations, including the Battle of Arnhem.
                    Although the letter was sent by a Dutch SS volunteer, it was nevertheless opened by the SS censor in
                    Berlin.</p>

                <p>Camp Amersfoort official designation as Polizeiliches Durchgangslager or Police Transit Camp is
                    misleading. Camp Amersfoort could just as easily be described as a penal or labor camp. Opened on
                    August 18, 1941, it was run by the German Security Police and held a mixture of Jews, political
                    prisoners, Jehova Witnesses and others. Camp Amersfoort was a brutal place, deservedly notorious for
                    the sadism of its guards, particularly towards Jewish inmates. Following the invasion of Russia in
                    June 1941, the camp held about 1,000 Uzbek and Soviet POWs, all of whom died of hardship or were
                    executed in nearby woods. Little is known about the camp workings, as most prisoners were not
                    allowed to send mail.</p>

                <h2> Konzentrationslager Herzogenbusch </h2>
                <p>Camp Vught, located near ‘s-Hertogenbosch, was referred to by the Germans as Konzentrationslager
                    Herzogenbusch. Unlike Camp Westerbork, which was controlled by the Security Police, the
                    Sicherheitsdienst (SD), Camp Vught was controlled by the SS Headquarters of the Economic
                    Administration in Berlin. Mail was mostly limited to thank-you notes for parcels received by
                    inmates, and they almost always received censorship markings. Special letter forms could be
                    purchased for 12 ½ cents. After censorship was carried out by an SS man located at the camp’s postal
                    station, the mail was then taken to ‘s-Hertogenbosch and cancelled at the town’s post office. Camp
                    Vught closed in late September 1944 when the Allies liberated southern Holland during Operation
                    Market Garden.

            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>After the Dutch surrender to the Germans in May 1940, the Dutch East Indies remained free and
                    unoccupied. German citizens living in the colony were arrested and interned to the outrage of
                    German
                    authorities.</p>
                <p>In retaliation, 400 Dutchmen were arrested in Holland. They became known as the Indische
                    Gijzelaars, the Indies Hostages. The Germans hoped that by arresting people who were on leave
                    from
                    the colony or had close ties with it, they would ensure proper treatment of the German
                    internees.
                    For this reason, the Indies Hostages were relatively well treated. Unlike the majority of
                    civilian
                    prisoners, they were allowed to receive Red Cross parcels, clothes and blankets. The Dutch
                    hostages
                    were initially taken to Zivilkonzentrationslager Buchenwald, but in November 1941, they were
                    moved
                    to Haarendael Major Seminary in the town of Haaren. They were then moved to Beekvliet Minor
                    Seminary
                    in St. Michielsgestel and then to a boarding school for boys called De Ruwenberg before finally
                    being sent to Camp Vught. Camp Haaren became the generic name for the three Dutch locations
                    where
                    the hostages were held.</p>

                <p>In 1942, another group of hostages, civilian internees, were interned at Beekvliet. They were
                    well-known scientists, politicians, government officials and artists. The Germans expected to
                    use these additional hostages to deter the Dutch underground from acts of resistance. Thus,
                    these internees were referred to as “anti-resistance hostages:” However, when the resistance
                    nevertheless carried out an attack on a Nazi troop train outside Rotterdam, the Germans executed
                    five of these hostages on August 15, 1942.</p>
