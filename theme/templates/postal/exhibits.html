                                Battle of Arnhem and its aftermath from the perspectives of the Dutch civilians and
                                German and British combatants whose lives intersected for ten days in Arnhem.</p>

                                of 1939, and its experience of the German invasion. German troops crossed the border in
                                the pre-dawn hours of Friday, May 10th, 1940 and by September 15th controlled the

                                divided between liberated areas and those still occupied. As an unusually cold winter
                                began, the Dutch in occupied areas were cut off from food supplies and on restricted
                                rations, resulting in starvation and hypothermia. In liberated areas, people were
                                searching for family members that had been separated from them and news of those still
                                in occupied areas.</p>
