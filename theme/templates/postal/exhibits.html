            <h1> Featured exhibits </h1>
            <p>Select material from the collection has been used to create a series of philatelic exhibits looking at the
                impact of World War II in Holland, focusing on the war's impact on the civilian population. Each exhibit
                consists of forty (40) tabloid pages and includes both philatelic and other original artifacts, organized
                around a central theme. The first exhibit "The Evolution of the Holocaust in Holland" looks at the Nazi's
                increasingly harsh measures against the Jewish population that ended in the death camps of Auschwitz and
                Sobibor. The second exhibit "False Hopes and Lasting Thanks" examines the impact of Operation Market Garden.
                Three further exhibits are currently in production, "Code Name Yellow: 1940-Invasion and Occupation of
                Holland," "Daily Life in Occupied Holland," and "The Hunger Winter and Liberation."

                            <p class="card-text">This exhibit shows in detail how the destruction of the Jewish population
                                in Holland evolved from pre-war Refugee Camps through a series of Transit and Concentration
                                Camps to the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Sobibor. Using contemporaneous correspondence and
                                related documents, the exhibit shows the clear progression from collection to internment and
                                on to deportation to the "East," ultimately resulting in the death of over 105,00 Dutch
                                Jews.</p>

                                liberation and the end of four years of German occupation in Holland. This exhibit looks at

                                Battle of Arnhem and its aftermath from the perspectives of the Dutch civilians and
                                German and British combatants whose lives intersected for ten days in Arnhem and the

                            <p class="card-text">This exhibit follows the initial mobilization of Dutch forces following the
                                German invasion of Poland in September
                                of 1939. Despite the Dutch's longstanding policy of neutrality, the invasion of Holland
                                began
                                when German troops crossed the border in
                                the pre-dawn hours of Friday, May 10th, 1940 under Operation FALL GELB (Case Yellow). Only
                                five
                                days later the Nazis controlled the entire
                                country except for a small area of Zeeland in the southwest. Zeeland would also soon fall.

                            <p class="card-text">After the disastrous Operation Market Garden, the Netherlands was
                                divided between liberated areas in the south and those still occupied by the Germans in the
                                north.
                                As an unusually cold winter
                                began in 1944/45, the Germans introduced a series of restrictive measures, intended as
                                punishment
                                for Dutch support, especially among rail workers, of the Allies during Operation Market
                                Garden.
                                Dutch civilians in occupied areas were cut off from food supplies and forced to survive on
                                restricted
                                rations, resulting in mass starvation and hypothermia. Meanwhile in the liberated areas,
                                people were
                                searching for family members displaced by the fighting and any news of those still living
                                in occupied areas.</p>
